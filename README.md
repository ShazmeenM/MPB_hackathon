# MPB_hackathon
Modelling Best Practice Hackathon. This pipeline creates a version of the Wordle game.  

# How to play Wordle?

1. Play the game by running main.py.  
2. The code will ask you to input a 5 letters long word in English.  
3. You will have 6 tries to guess the word.  
4. The game will exit if you have guessed the correct word.  
5. If you guess the exact position of a letter in the answer it will turn GREEN.  
6. If you guess a letter, but it is in the wrong position it turns YELLOW.  
7. If the letter does not exist, it will remain black ink.  
8. The game will exit when maximum guesses have been reached.
