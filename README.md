Modelling Best Practice Hackathon 

The pipeline creates a version of the Wordle game. The Wordle game should (upon running it in Python):

1. Randomly choose a 5 letters long word (English).   
2. Allow a user to enter a real word 5 letters long (words must be checked to make sure they are real English words).  
3. Returns whether each character entered for that word is:  
Black (letter not in chosen word)  
Green (letter in the word and in the correct position)  
Yellow (letter in the word but not in the correct position)  
4. Allow users to have a maximum of 6 guesses  
5. Exit the game if the user gets it correct   
6. Exit the game if maximum guesses have been reached
